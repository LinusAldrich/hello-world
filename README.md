# hello-world

Hi im Linus!

I started coding when I am 13 years old. What i Program is Html and Css and Python.
My Dad told me to see that kids code then I started to like programming.
I tried programming on the first time and I said its so hard then as it goes on I
started to understand the language. Then thats how I like to Code.
